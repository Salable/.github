Salable is the simplest way to accept payments in your application.

Let us handle the complication of payment, license, and subscription management so you can work on features that excite your users.

The Salable platform supports many types of licensing including flat-rate, tiered, usage-based and per-seat. So, however your application grows in the future - we have you covered.
